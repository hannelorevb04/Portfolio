      For our Arduino project, we built a piano allowing users to play music
      using push buttons. The piano is equipped with a buzzer for sound output
      and an LCD screen to display the keys being pressed. Additionally, there's
      a feature enabling users to automatically play and learn songs.

    <h2>How did we approach it?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Exploration:</span> In the exploration phase, we
        researched the technical capabilities of the Arduino platform to build a
        functional piano. We identified the necessary components such as push
        buttons, a buzzer, and an LCD screen. By studying existing DIY projects
        and documentation, we gained insight into the best approach to realize
        our idea.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Execution:</span> The execution phase involved
        implementing the various functions of the piano. We started by
        connecting the push buttons to the Arduino to simulate the piano keys.
        Then, we linked the buzzer to produce the sound of the piano when the
        keys are pressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Functional description:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Input and output:</span> We connected push
            buttons acting as piano keys. When a button is pressed, a signal is
            sent to the Arduino, which then activates the buzzer to produce the
            corresponding sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Serial communication:</span> Communication
            between the push buttons and the buzzer is essential for the
            operation of the piano. With each press of a button, the Arduino
            sends a signal to the buzzer to generate the correct sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">LCD:</span> The LCD screen is integrated to
            display the notes. When a key is pressed, the screen shows which
            note is played. Additionally, users can press a button to see an
            automatically played song displayed on the screen and attempt to
            play it.
